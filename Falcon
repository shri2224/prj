CrowdStrike has had its NPM packages compromised My big 'HACKED' stamp is back.

Crowdstrike has been caught in a Supply chain attack that so far includes 180 packages from various organizations.

Crowdstrike packages compromised include @crowdstrike/commitlint @crowdstrike/falcon-shoelace @crowdstrike/foundry-js @crowdstrike/glide-core @crowdstrike/logscale-dashboard @crowdstrike/logscale-file-editor @crowdstrike/logscale-parser-edit @crowdstrike/logscale-search @crowdstrike/tailwind-toucan-base

This appears to be a continuation of the Tinycolor attack first discovered by Daniel Pereira that Socket and StepSecurity had reported on. Both discovered that a combined 40 packages were compromised. Since then, an additional 140 packages have been compromised, including those from Crowdstrike. This is ongoing, so expect more compromises to

follow.

What the malware does

The malware steals credentials using webhook[.]site, this is especially bad because they are using a free-tier webhook[.]site account, which means all credentials stolen will be public; HOWEVER... it appears they are currently rate-limited, so new exfiltrations of credentials aren't working. This feels like a Zombie attack, as even though the exfiltration method isn't working, new attacks are ongoing, making it feel very automated...
