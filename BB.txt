each req are state less that's why we use cookie to stateful

A record maps ipv4

3)   Subdomain Enumeration

google dorking
crt.sh
subfinder 
assetfinder by = all tied to an entity, any entity that is owned like a sister company will be enumerated  , if you want to use this and see only our scope use grep like $ assetfinder azena.com | grep eg.com | sort -u (unique) > eg.txt
amass Enum -d  best but take time

To sort all the output
cat eg | sort -u > eg2.txt
cat eg2.txt >> (append) eg3.txt
now with all our output at eg3 sort unique to the final file
cat eg3.txt | sort -u > final.txt


To check what website are actually alive 

* httpprobe
cat final.txt | grep eg.com | sort -u | httprobe -prefer=https | grep https > alive.txt

* gowitness 
gowitness file -f final.txt -P dirname --no-http = will be getting the snip output 

note : rearch your own comfy tools like wayback etc and create a playbook
